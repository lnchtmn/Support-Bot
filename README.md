# Support-Bot
Bot for client support written with aiogram

This is simple Telegram bot written in one file
It sends client messages from bot to group
And sends answers from group to bot back

I have two files, one code made with polling method and other with webhook

For webhook you shoud also deploy requirements.txt and .gitignore


This code is not written safely, you probably should not keep your url, api token and chat id in one file with code and move them to another
But it was simpler and here you can see everything you need in one file and then export what you need in other files.
